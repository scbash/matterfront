# Matterfront

An application for [Mattermost](http://mattermost.org) for OS X, Windows, and Linux, powered by [Electron](http://electron.atom.io).

## Installation

First, clone down this project, and then from within that directory in your favorite terminal run:

```
>  npm install
// installs packages....
> npm link
// creates a local symlink
```
You're now ready to start developing against your local mattermost installation. Make sure
you have your `config.json` setup as noted in the steps below.

## Connecting to your team

For now, Matterfront is limited to one team connection. The url for your team is pulled from a json file in your home directory.

Create a text file at `~/.matterfront/state.json`. (Where `~` is your home directory). Make it look like this:

```json
{
  "teams": [{
    "url": "http://some.server.com/some-team"
  }]
}
```

You should be able to provide your credentials when Matterfront starts up.

Support for adding multiple teams through the UI is coming soon.

## --dev-mode

In dev-mode, we use webpack's hot-loader plugin for streamlined development.

To start the app in dev mode, start the webpack-dev-server like this:

```
npm run start-watch
```

Leave the dev server running, and then start matterfront in dev mode by running:

```
npm run start
```

Now as you edit your browser-side code, the app should update automatically, without even having to reload the page.

## Testing

This project contains a [Vagrant](https://vagrantup.com) environment, consisting of
a locally hostable mattermost instance you can use for testing. Alternatively, you can use your own production mattermost server.

### Use your production Mattermost instance

After following the configuration steps above, run `npm start` from within your matterfront directory

### Vagrant method

1. Set up your `config.json` using `"url":"http://192.168.33.33"`
2. run `vagrant up` from within your local
copy of this repo
3. run `npm start`

## Building your own app

First follow the install instructions above. Then from within your project root,
you can build for all platforms and distributions by running:

    npm run build

This will output the following distributions into the `/dist` directory:

```
dist/
 |- matterfront-darwin-x64/
 |- matterfront-linux-ia32/
 |- matterfront-linux-x64/
 |- matterfront-win32-ia32/
 |- matterfront-win32-x64/
```

Each directory contains an executable for the platform listed. For more detailed
build options, check out how to modify your `build` from within `package.json` by
using the options from [electron-packager](https://github.com/maxogden/electron-packager#usage) to modify your built artifacts.

If you are on Linux or OS X, you need Wine [for Windows builds](https://github.com/maxogden/electron-packager#building-windows-apps-from-non-windows-platforms).
